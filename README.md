# UVA 23F Computer Architecture Final Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code developed for the final project of the UVA 23F Computer Architecture course. The main focus of this project is on the implementation of a hardware accelerator for a sparse operator in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and the data analysis of sparse graph datasets using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Contents

1. **HW Accelerator Implementation**: This section includes the hardware description code of the hardware accelerator for a sparse operator in GNNs, namely symmetric sparse matrix-matrix multiplication. Please note that this implementation is specific to the architectural design and does not include testing components such as testbenches, instantiation of SRAM IPs, or board-specific configurations. These elements depend on the specific hardware being used and are not provided in this repository.
  
2. **Graph Dataset Analysis**: This Jupyter Notebook is used for analyzing sparse graph datasets. The notebook contains processing scripts, visualization tools for graph data. The data processing part can be expanded in the future to include logic for compressing embeddings into a specific format, which would be useful for practical testing.
